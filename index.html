                Fifty years ago, two kids were in love and ardently wanted to be together. So they got married. Over time, they came to embody true partnership. This is no small thing – to love each other deeply, to become committed fully, and to still relish the companionship and love after 50 years. Now is a time to honor and celebrate their love and togetherness.
